# Password

This is a simple random character password generator I wrote years ago because I needed a way to generate passwords for various websites as using the same password isn't a good idea ;)

There is no GNAT project file, it's a simple application which can be built with the following commands:

```bash
$ gnatmake password
```

## Example

```bash
$ ./password 20
Password is: t6HJYV6YKDSDEA6wYk8U  # Example use only, I have not used this.
```
